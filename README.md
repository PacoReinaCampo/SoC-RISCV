**Implementation in VHDL & (System)Verilog of a Multi-Processor System on Chip and simulation in GHDL & Icarus Verilog**

A Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is a System on Chip (SoC) which includes multiple Processing Units (PU). As such, it is a multi-core System-on-Chip. All PUs are linked to each other by a Network on Chip (NoC). These architectures meet the performance needs of multimedia applications, telecommunication architectures or network security.
