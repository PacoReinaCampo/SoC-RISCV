# DESIGN OF INSTRUCTIONS

The RISC-V ISA features a streamlined design for its instructions, aiming to balance simplicity, efficiency, and extensibility across a wide range of computing devices. Instructions are structured to be fixed-width (32 or 64 bits) and are categorized into different types and extensions to accommodate diverse application needs.
